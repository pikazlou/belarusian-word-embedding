The dataset and corresponding validation (outlier detection) is based on 8-8-8 dataset for intrinsic evaluation of word embedding.
Referencen implementation was taken from here: http://lcl.uniroma1.it/outlier-detection/

Additional good overview of word embedding evaluaion is available in "Evaluating Word Embedding Models: Methods and Experimental Results": https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09785
